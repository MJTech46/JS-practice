# JavaScript Practice Repository  

Welcome to my **JavaScript Practice Repository**! ðŸŽ‰  

This repository serves as a general-purpose collection of **JavaScript mini and micro projects**, created to sharpen my skills in JavaScript development. Each folder represents a standalone project, tackling a specific concept, functionality, or challenge in JavaScript.  

## Repository Structure  

- **Mini Projects:** Small applications focusing on a single feature or use case.
- **Micro Projects:** Bite-sized exercises or snippets solving specific programming problems.  

Each folder is organized to include:  
- **`index.html`** (if applicable): The UI for interacting with the project.  
- **`main.js`:** The JavaScript code that powers the project.  
- **Other Files:** Supporting assets like stylesheets or JSON files, depending on the project.  

## Goals of This Repository  

1. **Improve JavaScript Fundamentals:** Practice core JS concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and ES6+ syntax.  
2. **Experiment with Features:** Explore JavaScript capabilities and apply them to solve interesting problems.  
3. **Build Fun Projects:** Create practical and engaging projects that showcase the versatility of JavaScript.
